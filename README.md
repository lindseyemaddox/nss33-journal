# nss33-journal

### The Daily Journal application used to take the concepts I learn in class, practice with the exercises, and apply them elaboratively throughout the course.

#### Part Two Objective
##### Build a data structure to represent a journal entry, and then define the data structure for storing a collection of entries.

#### Part Four Objective
##### Build a function that returns an HTML representation of a journal entry data structure and render it to the DOM.

#### Part Five Objective
##### Modularize the JavaScript. Create several JavaScript files which each have a single responsibility. Then you will need to include them in your index.html in the correct order.

#### Part Six Objectives
##### Apply event listeners and querying the DOM to make daily journal form save entries to API. Also use fetch to make a POST request to your API, while using a factory function to generate the object that will be saved.
